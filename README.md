TOP's Rock, Paper, Scissors project

I started this project on on Sunday 6/4 and finished on Thursday 6/9, although today (6/9) was pretty much just verifying everything worked again and then pushing it all to github. I spent roughly 5.5hrs on it and I feel really good about it. I was doubting myself a lot before this project, but I think I did a pretty good job, and I'm happy with how it turned out. I think it's pretty good that TOP kind of just leaves it all up to you with the exception of a few hints, because working on this project taught me a lot when it comes to Googling questions and using resources like Stack Overflow and YouTube.

Update: 08/02/2022
It took me awhile to get back to this project because I had a water leak in my house (what a headache!) but as soon as everything was resolved I was back to studying. I started the TOP revisit of this RPS project on 7/26/22 and it took me 4 days to finish it and that was spending about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes a day on it. I came into this revisit with very low confidence and feeling like I was going to fail, but that didn't happen, and I'm really glad I stuck with it and didn't quit. The revisit involved me removing parts of the code I didn't need anymore (parts for playing in the browser), and doing a lot of DOM manipulation so that the game would work with actual player interaction and not just typing into the console.
