TOP's Rock, Paper, Scissors project

I started this project on on Sunday 6/4 and finished on Thursday 6/9, although today (6/9) was pretty much just verifying everything worked again and then pushing it all to github. I spent roughly 5.5hrs on it and I feel really good about it. I was doubting myself a lot before this project, but I think I did a pretty good job, and I'm happy with how it turned out. I think it's pretty good that TOP kind of just leaves it all up to you with the exception of a few hints, because working on this project taught me a lot when it comes to Googling questions and using resources like Stack Overflow and YouTube.
